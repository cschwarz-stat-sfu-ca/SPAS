# Introduction

Several vignettes explored how to pool rows and/or columns to deal with the near singularity
of the recapture matrix. A new function has been introduced *SPAS.autopool()* that attempts
to automate this process.

The automatic pooling algorithm follows recommendations in Schwarz and Taylor (1998)
and proceeds as follows:

- All rows that have 0 releases are discarded
- All columns that have 0 recaptures of tagged fish and 0 fish inspected are discarded
- Starting at the first row and working forwards in time,
and then working from the final row and working backwards in time,
rows are pooled until a minimum of \code(min.released) are released.
An alternating pooling (from the top, from the bottom, from the top, etc) is used
- Starting at the first column and working forwards in time,
and then working from the final column and working backwards in time,
columns are pooled until a minimum of \code(min.inspected) are inspected.
An alternating pooling (from the left, from the right, from the left, etc) is used.
- If the sum of the total recaptures from released fish is <= \code{min.recaps}, then all rows are pooled
(which reduces to a Chapman estimator)

The values of \code{min.released},\code{min.inspected},\code{min.recaps} can be passes as
arguments to the function.

The function returns a suggested pooling vector for the rows and columns and a reduced
data matrix if there are rows that are all zero or columns that are all zero.

The *SPAS.fit.model()* function also now has a *autopool* argument where an automated
pooling will be attempted rather than you passing the pooling vectors.

# Example. 

The example from the Harrison River will be used:

## Load the SPAS package

```{r libraries}
library(SPAS)
```
This will load the SPAS fitting functions and any associated packages needed by SPAS.

## Import the data.

The data  should be stored as an $s+1$ by $t+1$ (before pooling) matrix.
The $s \times t$ upper left matrix is the number of animals released in row stratum $i$ and recovered in
column stratum $j$. 
Row $s+1$ contains the total number of UNMARKED animals recovered in column stratum $j$.
Column $t+1$ contains the number of animals marked in each row stratum but not recovered in any column stratum.
The $rawdata[s+1, t+1]$ is not used and can be set to 0 or NA.
The sum of the entries in each of the first $s$ rows is then the number of animals marked in each row stratum.
The sum of the entries in each of the first $t$ columns is then the number of animals captured (marked and unmarked) in each column stratum.
The row/column names of the matrix may be set to identify the entries in the output.

Here is the raw data for the Harrison River. Notice that very small number of releases and recoveries in week 6. 

```{r loaddata}
harrison.2011.chinook.F.csv <- textConnection("
  4   ,      2   ,      1   ,     1   ,     0   ,     0   ,   130
 12   ,      7   ,     14   ,     1   ,     3   ,     0   ,   330
  7   ,     11   ,     41   ,     9   ,     1   ,     1   ,   790
  1   ,     13   ,     40   ,    12   ,     9   ,     1   ,   667
  0   ,      1   ,      8   ,     8   ,     3   ,     0   ,   309
  0   ,      0   ,      0   ,     0   ,     0   ,     1   ,    65
744   ,   1187   ,   2136   ,   951   ,   608   ,   127   ,     0")

har.data <- as.matrix(read.csv(harrison.2011.chinook.F.csv, header=FALSE))
har.data
```

A total of `r sum(har.data[1,])` fish were tagged and released in week 1. Of these fish, `r har.data[1,1]` were recovered down stream in column stratum 1;
`r har.data[1,2]` were recovered in column stratum 2; and `r har.data[1,7]` were never seen again.
A total of `r har.data[7,1]` UNMARKED fish were recovered in column stratum 1.

You can add row and column names to the matrix which will used when the data are printed.

## Automate Pooling

We invoke the *SPAS.autopool()* function and look at the output:

```{r}
res <- SPAS.autopool(har.data)
res

```

There were no rows or columns that were all zero, so the 
reduced data (*res*) is the same as the original data.

The suggested pooling vector for columns indicates no pooling was done (all entries are the same).
The suggested pooling vector for rows, suggests rows 5 and 6 be pooled as indicated by the
duplicate entries of *6* in the pooling vector.

Finally, the reduced data and suggest pooling vectors are presented in one display.

## Fitting allowing for automated pooling.

We can use the *autopool* argument in the *SPAS.fit.model* to do automated pooling
prior to the fit.

```{r}
mod..1 <- SPAS.fit.model(har.data,
                       model.id="Automated pooling",
                       autopool=TRUE)
SPAS.print.model(mod..1)
```

The automated pooling combined the last two rows, but the fit is not entire satisfactory
because of the high condition number on *X'X*.

Some further bespoke pooling is likely necessary.

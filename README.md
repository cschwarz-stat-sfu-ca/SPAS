```

## Features
This is an R version of the Windoze program SPAS to estimate population abundance
using a Stratified Petersen Estimator (Darroch 1961; Plante et al 1998; Schwarz and Taylor, 1998)

The user is allows to pool rows and/or columns prior to analysis but the number of rows must be
less than or equal to the number of columns (s <= t). The conditional likelihood formulation of
Plante et al (1998) is used to estimate the parameters. 

A good discussion 
of how to decide on pooling rows/columns is found in Schwarz and Taylor (1998). The *row.physical.pool*
parameter allows you to choose between physical pooling of rows, or logical pooling of rows (the underlying
data table is unchanged, but capture probabilities for the pooled rows are forced equal). It is not possible
to do logical pooling of columns and only physical pooling is possible. See the help() function 
for details.

If the data are physically pooled prior to analysis, it is not possible to compare different
poolings to see which is most appropriate using AIC or likelihood ratio tests. If you do logical 
pooling of rows, you can compare poolings using AIC or likelihood ratio methods.

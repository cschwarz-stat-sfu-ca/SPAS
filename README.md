## Features
This is an R version of the Windoze program SPAS to estimate population abundance
using a Stratified Petersen Estimator (Darroch 1961; Plante et al 1998; Schwarz and Taylor, 1998)

The user is allows to pool rows and/or columns prior to analysis but the number of rows must be
less than or equal to the number of columns (s <= t). The conditional likelihood formulation of
Plante et al (1998) is used to estimate the parameters. 

Because the data are physically pooled prior to analysis, it is not yet possible to compare different
poolings to see which is most appropriate - this is under active investigation. A good discussion 
of how to decide on pooling rows/columns is found in Schwarz and Taylor (1998).

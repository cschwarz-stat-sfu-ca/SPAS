Description: The Stratified-Petersen Analysis System (SPAS) is designed
    to estimate abundance in two-sample capture-recapture experiments 
    where the capture and recaptures are stratified. This is a generalization
    of the simple Lincoln-Petersen estimator.
    Strata may be defined in time or in space or both, 
    and the s strata in which marking takes place 
    may differ from the t strata in which recoveries take place.
    When s=t, SPAS reduces to the method decribed by 
    Darroch (1961) <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2332748>.
    When s<t, SPAS implements the methods described in
    Plante, Rivest, and Tremblay (1988) 
    <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2533994>.
    Schwarz and Taylor (1998) <https://doi.org/10.1139/f97-238> describe
    the use of SPAS in estimating return of salmon stratified by
    time and geography. 
    A related package, BTSPAS, deals with temporal stratification where 
    a spline is used to model the distribution of the population 
    over time as it passes the second capture location.
    This is the R-verson of the (now obsolete) standalone Windows 
    program available at <http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~popan/spas/spas_home.html>.
